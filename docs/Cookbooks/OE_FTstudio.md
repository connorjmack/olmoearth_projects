# Get Started with OlmoEarth Studio

This Get Started guide is intended as a quick way to start programming with the Earth Engine JavaScript API. For an introductory look at JavaScript and more in-depth exercises with the Earth Engine API, see the tutorials. For recommended JavaScript coding style, see the Google JavaScript Style Guide.

Google Earth Engine allows users to run algorithms on georeferenced imagery and vectors stored on Google's infrastructure. The Google Earth Engine API provides a library of functions which may be applied to data for display and analysis. Earth Engine's public data catalog contains a large amount of publicly available imagery and vector datasets. Private assets can also be created in users' personal folders.
